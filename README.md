# Anatomy Of A Trial

Created by Peter Kinoy, Nora Christiani, Meka Montanez, Blake Hunsicker, and Zachary Dinerstein.

### Overview
This project was built for the POV Hackathon on November 8th and 9th 2014. Anatomy Of A Trial takes Peter Kinoy's documentory footage from the Genocide trial of General Rios Montt, and creates an interactive experience for a user, weaving trial footage with local interviews, and supporting data. 

### Best viewing experience
Best viewed in Chrome on a screen that's 1260 x 780.

### What you'll see
The app opens on the trial of Rios Montt. While you watch the trial, a side bar will appear, indicating that there's extra material available which supports the scene you're watching. Click on the flashing icon to view those materials.

You'll also see a video icon appear in the top left corner of the app. This indicates that there's footage from outside of the trial -- including interviews with locals and with Rio Muntt's daughter -- ready for you to view. Click on the icon in the top left of the screen to be taken to those videos. 

While watching supplimental videos, click on the tab marked "Back to Trial" in the top left of the screen to be taken back to the trial video.

Thank you for watching!
